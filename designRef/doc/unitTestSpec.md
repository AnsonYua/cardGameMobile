1.i predefined some gameEnv/gameStatus in backend. this just like a test case. by calling the action SetScenario in DebugControl.ts. it will set the gameid with my target environment.

2.i want u create some javascript function call such that u can trigger SetScenario. with these function you can make use of chrome-dev mcp to call these javascript in window.document and set a environment for me to further testing. this is the very first step of all test case.
